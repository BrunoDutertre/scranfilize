Scramble CNFs in DIMACS format.
==================================================================

To build `scranfilize` use

  `./configure && make`

or include testing

  `./configure && make test`

which produces scrambled versions of the CNFs in 'cnfs' in 'log'.

To understand what `scranfilize` can do run

  `./scranfilize -h`

after building it.

This tool is described in our [POS'18 paper]<http://fmv.jku.at/papers/BiereHeule-POS18.pdf>
which also comes with [experiments]<http://fmv.jku.at/scranfilize>.
